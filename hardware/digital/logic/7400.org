* 7400 (64)

- wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/7400-series_integrated_circuits
- TI = Texas Instruments
- logic family of originally TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) IC's
  - "an integrated circuit made in CMOS is NOT a TTL chip, since it uses *Field-Effect Transistors* (FETs) and NOT *Bipolar Junction Transistors* (BJT)"

- multiplexers
  - used for memory decoding (to enable chips based on address bits)
  - the ENABLE pin could be used as an extra address decoding bit
