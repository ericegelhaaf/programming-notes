** 8-bit computer update

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyznrdDSSGM

- Enhancements over SAP-1
  - Decimal display instead of binary display
  - Added "Load Immediate", "Store A" instructions
  - Added "Jump instructions" (original didn't have?)

** 8-bit computer clock
*** Astable    555 timer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRlSFm519Bo

- ~Astable~: there are no stable binary state

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./555ast.jpg]][[./555astschema.jpg]]

- 555 has inside:
  * 2 Comparators (2 inputs and 1 output, if input a<b output is on, if not is off)
  * 1 Flip-Flip (aka RS Latch)
  * 3 5k resitances, that made a =voltage divider=
  * 1 Transistor (on to discharge ~pin 7~ and to GND)

- rate of charging and discharging times, will depend on:
  - charging: 1k / 100k / 1uf
  - discharging: 100k
    - we can swap the 100k resistor for a variable resistor (with a serial resistor to provide a floor)

- Recommendations:
  - Sheet, put a 0.01uf =capacitor= from ~pin 5~ (CV) to GND, for no janky OUTPUT
  - Sheet, lock/tying ~pin 4~ (RESET latch) to VCC
  - Some other overshoot/spikes of output might be due noise in our cable *impedance*, try:
    - reducing the size of the cable
    - or putting a 0.1uf capacitor between GND and VCC pins (the closest to the chip the better)
      - on circuits, chips usually do have capacitor near for this reason

#+CAPTION: with recommendations
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
[[./555asmod.jpg]]

*** Monostable 555 timer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81BgFhm2vz8

- ~Monostable~: there is 1 binary state that is stable

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
[[./555mono.jpg]][[./555monoschema.jpg]]

- We want to switch to a *manual control* of the clock
  - One Tick per Button Push
  - But, we CANNOT /just/ use a button, due it will physically bounce.
  - To *debounce* the button we use another =555=
    - with a very small capacitor
    - And a button on pin 2 (trigger)

- Next problem: How to switch between both?

*** Bistable   555 timer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WCwJNnx36Rk

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
[[./555bis.jpg]][[./555bischema.jpg]]

- We can use a switch to go output either the Astable or Monostable.
  - BUT, we still need some *debounce* on the switch.
  - Even when switches are either, "break before make" or "make before break"

- This time ( differently from above (for fun) )
  We would use just the internal *SR Latch*.

*** Clock logic

- Out of the 3 circuits we have so far.
- We need to make it 1, with 1 output.
- We use Logic gates
  - 1 ~74LS04~ (Hex  NOT (Inverter))
  - 1 ~74LS08~ (Quad AND gate)
  - 1 ~74LS32~ (Quad OR gate)

#+CAPTION: select=bistable - manual=monostable
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 550
[[./555allclock.jpg]]

- Alternatively, It could be repesented just with NOR or NAND gates
  - 2 ~74LS00~ (4 NAND gates)

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./555allnandclock.jpg]]

** Latches
*** S(et)R(eset) Latch

- A simple OR gate can *hold/latch* an input value
  - if one input is hooked directly to the output of it
  - even if retriggered, it will keep holding the value, until poweroff
  - Example circuit uses an ~74LS32~
   #+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
   [[./srlatchOR.jpg]]

- If we want a way to *reset* the latch, we could use 2 NOR gates
  - with the output inverted (feeding the other NOR gate)
  - 4 I/O's usually labeled S/R and Q/Ǭ
  - setting both inputs ON is an _invalid state_
  - it is completely random which gate will start with 1
  - Example circuit uses an ~74LS02~
   #+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
   [[./srlatchNOR.jpg]]

*** D(ata)       Latch

- We want instead of 2 INPUTS, a single INPUT instead, that still latches one bit of *Data*
  - A naive approach of feeding D and Di (D inverse) would NOT latch/keep

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 750
[[./dlatch.jpg]]

- Modifications before the SR-latch
  - Add 2(two) *AND* gates
  - Add an *Enable Input* signal, to only change data when signaled
  - Add an *inverter* to decouple the input data

*** D            flip-flop

- (End of review 00:03:00)

- A variation of the D-latch
- To only latch to new values at transitions of the clock from low to high.
  - and NOT latch through the whole clock cycle
  - instead of the *Enable Input* we have a *Clock Input*
  - with an ~edge detector~, to detect a raising into a pulse
    1) With an AND with inputA and inputA negated.
       We take advantage of the fact that the *invertor* takes a small amount of time to switch states
    2) Simpler yet.
       A resistor and a capacitor.
       When the capacitor is fully charged, no current will go through it.
       #+begin_src

       #+end_src
       - 0.1uf = 0.1 * 10^-6
         1K = 10^3
         0.1 * 10^-6 * 10^3 = 0.1ms is how long the pulse will last

** 8 bit register

- Parts needed, either:
  1) With basic 74xx ICs
     - 1x 74245 - transceiver
     - 1x 7474  - 2 D-type flip-flops
     - 1x 7404  - NOT
     - 1x 7408  - AND
     - 1x 7432  - OR
  2) With more prepackaged ones
     - 2x 74173 - 4-bit d-latch register (already has 3-state)
     - 1x 74245 - tranceiver (to see the state of registers)

*** Bus architecture and how register transfers work

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QzWW-CBugZo

#+CAPTION: The Bus
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 600
[[./thebus.jpg]]

- The =Bus=
  - *Registers* interface with it
  - in this project there is only 1 bus of 8 bits (usually you have more buses)
  - is a /common connection point/ for the different components
  - allows /bus transfers/, aka move data between components
  - each component/module/part
    1) has inputs and outputs connected to the bus
    2) has /control lines/ signals
       1) a LOAD signal: to (R)ead from the bus
       2) an ENABLE signal: to (W)rite into the bus
    3) has the same CLOCK input signal

*** Tri-state logic: Connecting multiple outputs together

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faAjse109Q8

- ONLY 1 component should be sending data to the bus at the time
  - You need a way to *disconnect* each chip OUTPUT who isn't sending data.
  - A 0 or a 1 is NOT enough, as it will sink or generate current.

- On each chip, there is usually a *OUTPUT STAGE*:
  #+ATTR_ORG: :width 150
  [[https://i.sstatic.net/M588G.png]]
  - It has 2 transistors.
  - We can disconnect both to achive the desired state.

- Such gates are the ~tri-state~ gates (74245 has many)
  [[https://www.electronics-lab.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Tristate-Buffer-TT.png]]
  - 0
  - 1
  - disabled

- *ENABLE* PIN to connect the circuit and output the data stored, we need to make sure only one of the chips has this flag set
- *LOAD* PIN, on the next clock will read

*** Designing and building a 1-bit register

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-arYx_oVIj8

- LOAD
  - We could use *D flip-flops*
    #+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
    [[./1bitreg.jpg]]
    - but we need to add some logic to have it either
      1) load a new value
      2) or load the same old vlue

- ENABLE
  - We use a tri-state buffer, to not always send our output to BUS
  - ~74245~, has support for both directions tri-state buffer, aka a transceiver
  - In our case we want to data to go into 1(one) direction (LOAD)

- LOAD & ENABLE
  - Instead of all the above, we could use instead one 74173
  - ~74173~, which has 4-bit D-Type Registers
  - Designed to work as a register
  - Has
    - 4 D-type flip-flops
    - logic gates
    - Tri-State outputs

*** Building an 8-bit register

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMaWbz_6E8

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./register.jpg]]

- By default, with ~74173~ you cannot see what is stored on the registers.
  - We can add a separate Tri-State chip ~74245~ and set the 173 to always output.
  - We and up connecting output and inputs together, as they will only do 1 thing at the time.
  - 173 have a CLR pin, that can be used on reset

*** Testing our computer's registers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WE3Obdjtv0

- Any TTL chip will default to a HIGH input
  - If you don't connect to anything (aka the bus is not connected)
  - It has a pull-up resistor inside the chip input.

- For this project, we are going to need 3 registers
  - 2 equal to above
  - 1 build with the 4 most significant bits NOT GOING BACK into the bus
    - for the =instruction registry= (aka decoder)

** Twos complement: Negative numbers in binary

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qH4unVtJkE

- Ways of representing negative numbers:
  1. using the MSB fas a naive =sign bit= (sign & magnitude?)
     - you have a negative 0
     - you CANNOT add
  2. =ones complement=: for negative we flip/complement the bits
     - you have a negative 0
     - you CANNOT add (kind of works if you "add 1" to the addition)
  3. =twos complement=: for negative we flip/complement the bits, and add 1
     - removes the "-0" of ones complement
     - the MSB acts like "-8"
     - you CAN add

** ALU - Arithmetic Logic Unit

- Parts Needed
  - Adder
    - 2x - 74283 - 4-bit adder
    - alternative
      - 2x XOR 7486
      - 2x AND 7408
      - 1x OR  7432
  - 2x - 7486 - XOR
  - 1x - 74245 (Octal bus transceiver) (aka for the tri-state)

*** 4bit adder with gates

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvJc9CZcvBc
- (see also computerphile version https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPw9vPN-3ac)

- You need to build a circuit that knows how to do all the possible binary sums.
  - The =half adder= part (doesn't account for a carry IN)
  #+begin_src
        A   B   c(arry)  S(sum)
        0 + 0 = 0\       0\
        0 + 1 = 0 |<AND> 1 |<XOR>
        1 + 0 = 0 |      1 |
        1 + 1 = 1/       0/
  #+end_src
  - Plus those sums with a (c)arry IN
  #+begin_src
    c   A   B   c S
    1 + 0 + 0 = 0 1\
    1 + 0 + 1 = 1 0 |<XOR>
    1 + 1 + 0 = 1 0 |(inverse of the above S)
    1 + 1 + 1 = 1 1/ (so we XOR 1(carry) with above S)
  #+end_src

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 300
[[./fulladder4bit.jpg]]

*** Design

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOVOS9AjgFs

- We have 2 registers
  - IO connected to the BUS
  - And =directly connected= to the ALU

[[./alugeneral.jpg]]

- ALU
  - 2x ~74283~ is a 4-bit adder with fast carry
  - 1x ~74~ XOR
    #+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
    [[./aluzoom.jpg]]
  - Two custom signals
    1) EO (output signal, dump the result to the BUS)
       - We add to the OUTPUT a tri-state buffer
       - E for "sigma" as being the sum
    2) SU (subtract signal)
       - whether we are adding(0) or subtracting(1)
       - We XOR the INPUT of one register
         - since it negates the input *if the SU signal is 1*
         - a sort of "conditional invertor"
       - We connect the free CARRY INPUT to the SU (since it will add the 1 for the neede =twos complement=)

*** Building

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-3fXU3FZQc

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./alubuild.jpg]]

*** Troubleshooting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Q8-2YZTUU

1) Clear both registers to 0(zero)

2) Try enabling one bit at the time in the A register until the sum (with zero) stops showing on the ALU.
   - Does the same with B register

3) Uses a multimeter
   - one probe to GND
   - other follows the cable to test voltage

4) Finally, try some sums

*** Testing

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nCMDvnR2Fg

- Connect the output of the ALU to the BUS
- Feeds the sum back into register A
  - using the manual clock and manual steps
  - using the automatic clock and potentiometer for speed

** 8-bit computer RAM

- 2x 74189 "A 64-bit Random Access Memory, with 3-state"
- 2x 7404 NOT gates (with 74219 RAM these won't be necessary)
- 1x 74245 tranceiver (for ram)
- 1x 74173 4-bit register, to store the address register
- 4x 74157 quad 2-line to 1-line selector/multiplexor (to switch between the 2 operation modes, and control signal of WE)

*** Intro

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FnxPIZR1ybs

- DRAM memory
  - uses the simplest possible representation for a bit.
  - A transistor and a capacitor.
  - Refreshing each bit to avoid capacitor to loss charge.

- SRAM memory
  - More complex, more expensive
  - Faster
  - Built from latches
    #+ATTR_ORG: :width 450
    [[./memorylatchbank.jpg]]


- For a 16*8 memory, we need an =address decoder= (aka a way to address the row of memory)
  1) From 4 address input bits, we add the negated input.
  2) We feed different combinations to 16 AND gates. Each in charge of an EN?(able) signal
  3) We have similar AND gates for WR (write enable)
  #+ATTR_ORG: :width 200
  [[./memorydecoder1.jpg]] [[./memorydecoder2.jpg]]

- 2x 74189 "A 64-bit Random Access Memory"
  - outputs are inverted, so we are going to need to reinvert them before sending to the bus
  #+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
  [[./74ls189.jpg]]

*** Build - Memory bank

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYXwCBo40iA

- Address 4-bits are tied together between the 2 chips.
  - CE is the one that determines which one will use

- memories will be always CE
  - output controlled by a ~74245~
  - only used in 1 direction, from RAM to bus
  - address input won't come directly from the bus

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./memorybank.jpg]]

*** Build - Address register

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNve2LCcSRc

- We add an =address register= for the 4bit address ~74173~
  - OE Always enabled
  - With a control line for DE
  - RESET connected low
  - That receives the address from the BUS.
  - To then receive data from the bus to the memory OR
    - data from the memory to the bus.

- We want to have 2 separate *modes of operation*
  1) Where we get addresses from the address registry (BUS?)
  2) Where we can program the computer manually the computer with (with dip switches)

#+ATTR_ORG: :width 500
[[./memoryaddr.jpg]]

- Ways to *select/switch* between the 2 modes.
  1) Using logic gates
     #+CAPTION: A=A0 B=A1 SELECT=switch
     [[./memoryselect1.jpg]]
  2) or with a ~74157~ has 4 copies of the above circuit
     [[./memoryselect2.jpg]]

*** Build - Data lines

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rl1tEFXKt0

- We also want the 2 modes to work with the 8 data bits
  - we need 2 additional ~74157~ (4-bit switch selector)
  - to either
    - receive from the BUS
    - receive from the dipswitches

- for the write (to memory) *control signal*, we want the option to trigger it with a button
  - we normally receive the signal from the =control unit=
  - or manually trigger it with a button
  - we need an additional ~74157~
  - we then NAND ~7400~
    - the clock WITH the control signal
    - not an AND because the signal is active low

*** Testing and Troubleshooting

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw3uDOUJRGw

00:03:04 OR00:16:13

- When something is not connected you will see all 1's
- We added the edge detector to work with the NAND for the write flag
  - with a capacitor(0.01uf)+resistance(1k)

** Program Counter

- For a jK flipfop
  - 1x 7402 NOR
  - 1x 7411 AND

- 1x 7476 - 2 jk flipflops

*** JK flip-flop

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1OC5e7Tn_o

- Derived from an SR Latch
  1) Adding an *enable* through 2 ANDs
     [[https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/gated-S-R-latch-circuit-diagram.jpg]]
  2) (SR Flip-Flop) Adding an =edge detected= *clock* through 2 ANDs, instead of the *enable*
     [[https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/sr-flip-flop-circuit.jpg]]
  3) (JK Flip-Flop) As above, but with a *feedback* from both Q and notQ back into the ANDs
     - "JK" has no meaning
     - Resilent when both are up (1), it will toggle latch
     - Unlike the undefined behaviour of SR flip-flop
     [[https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/articles/J-K-flip-flop-diagram.jpg]]

*** JK flip-flop - racing problems

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=st3mUEub99E

- If we build it with gates just as abovethe above
  - it will toggle on the raising edges
  - too many times
  - too fast
  - even with the cap+res deboucer

- There is a *racing* condition happening between
  1) the pulse width of the edge detector (cap+res)
  2) the toggle that happens on a JK flip-flop when both inputs are 1

- We can try
  1) reduce the ohm of the resistor
  2) But there are limits of how sharp pulses are going to be on a breadboard
     - *Inductance* can fluctuate just from being touched and changing the capacitance

*** TODO JK flip-flop Master-slave Flip-Flop

[[https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/flipflop-1.jpg]]

00:00:33

- Only one of the SR-latche is active at the time

- ~7476~ "Dual Master-Slave J-K Flip Flops with Clear, Preset, and Complementary outputs"

- Instead of the edge detector
  * we chain 2 JK flip-flop together + clock input to each (one inversed)
  * and add some feedback

- On clock UP one flips, on clock DOWN the other flips

*** Binary counter

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exGEmA67dNc

- 1x ~7476~ has 2 jk flipflops
- PRESET and CLEAR pins are ways to set the output regardless of JK or CLOCK (an override)
  - L H, sets Q high
  - H L, sets Q low
  - L L, invalid/unstable

- The resulting toggle velocity is HALF of the input clock.
  - aka a "divide by 2"
  - If we feed the output of the flip flop into the clock of other flip flop.
  - We HALF again the clock speed.
  - We have a ~binary counter~

*** Design

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_1HyxBzjl0

#+CAPTION: SAP-1 architecture
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 700
[[./sapdesign.jpg]]

- We don't want the clock "counting" every clock cycle.
  - An instruction might take multiple clocks to execute.
- Properties
  * Needs to be able to count
  * It Stores a value (like a register)
  * Needs to R/W into the BUS
- Control Signals
  1) CO: Program Counter Out (when to output data to the bus)
  2) JUMP: Program Input from BUS
  3) CE: Count Enable, will increment on each clock cycle
- 1x ~74LS161A~ "Synchronous 4-bit binary counters"
  It has 4 JK Flip-Flops
  It has the CE flag, CO, and data inputs.
  It has a carry output to be feed into other chip clock to chain.
  4-bit I/O
- It still need the tri-state buffer IC (~74LS245~)

*** Build

- Unused Tri-state output bits are GND
- Tri-State buffer output is connected to both
  1. the counter input (for JUMP)
  2. to the BUS
- Tri-state buffer input is connected to the output of the counter

** Output Display
*** 1 - Designing a 7-segment hex decoder
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zffjsXqATg&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=30
- 3x 7-Segment LD, 1Digit, Common anode
  - Each pin, lights up a "segment"
  - Using 4 bits, it gives you an hexa display
- Naive way, If we think it as:
  "what is the circuit that satisfies the truth table for this segment?"
   Where the truth table values are the numbers in binary
   - 17 ORs, 33ANDs, 4NOTs (Too complex)
*** 2 - Using an EEPROM to replace combinational logic
     ROM - Only Read
    PROM - Programable Once
   EPROM - Can be ereased through UV lights
  EEPROM - Erased programmatically
- 1x AT28C16 - ATMEL 16K (2K x8) Parallel EEPROM
  8x I/O, input if programming, normally output
  11x address lines (to a tip switch)
  WE: Write enable
  OE: Output enable
  CE: Chip Enable (when low, the chip is enabled)
  No Current limiter to the output.
- Write Protocol:
  - OE set to high (?)
  - Low pulse, on CE or WE (between 100ns-1000ns)
  - Will latch the *address* first and at the end of the pulse the *data*
- Build and RC circuit, with button switch to trigger the WE, and a tip switch to put the address
  1nf cap and 610ohm = 610ns
  + 10k resistor to allow capacitor to discharge
*** 3 - Build an Arduino EEPROM programmer

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K88pgWhEb1M&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=32

- Programming the addresses (input) and data for the hex (output)
- Arduino has 14 I/O digital pins (12 if we are using serial interface, hence using the TX and RX pins)
  We need to control 21 pins: 11 address + 8 IO + WE + OE = 21

- There is way for us to use only a couple (!!!) of pins of the Arduino
  With a ~shift register~
  - uses several *D flip-flops* chained, the input bit "travels" across the flip-flops
  - It has a single input, but many outputs

- 1X ~74HC595~ - "8-bit serial-in, seria or parallel-out shift register with output latches; 3-state"
  - Reduce it to 3 signals (DATA INPUT, ST_CP, SH_CP)
  - No current limiter on the the output
  - We can cascade them if we want
  - Storage resister (8-bit)
    - ST_CP: storage register clock pulse,
             if 1 (or unplugged) sends to output
             if 0 holds the input without output it
  - Shift-register pins
    - DS: data serial input
    - SH_CP: shift clock pulse
    - MR: master reset (set to high to not reset)
    - OE: output enable (set to low to enable our outputs)

- Arduino Programming
  - Set Address
    - shiftOut() - sends the value provided (an int) to the pin provided, shifting with a clock into the target pin
    - address >> 8
    - (address >> 8) | (outputEnable ? 0x00 : 0x80)
  - Reading
    - data = (data << 1) + digitalRead()
  - Writing
    - Setup: We need to make sure it starts HIGH, on this order to avoid it going low
      digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH) // Sets the pullup resistor
      pinMode(PIN, OUTPUT)    // set the pinmode to output, which is already high

- Our custom instruction
  - is actually made from different control signals.
  - is made of 4 bits of operations and 4 bits of operand
  - operand can be a memory address
- Some common, the ~fetch operation~

*** Part 2
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7rCxs1ppyY&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=37
- ~microinstruction~ Each of the steps control signals done by our "ASM"
- We need to know on which step of the microinstruction we are in.
- We need 2 clocks. We use an inverter on the main one.
  1) Control logic
  2) Execution
- 1x 74LS161A - "Synchronous 4-bit Binary Counters"
  - CLK
  - 4 Outputs
  - 4 Data Inputs (not used)
- 1x 74LS138 "Decoder/Demultiplexer"
  - Converts the binary number into different signals
    - From 0 to 7
    - We can connect the rest of the counter to the demutiplexer
    - 0001 - 0001
      0010 - 0010
      0011 - 0100
      0100 - 1000
- We can use an EEPROM to replace sequential logic, to interpret the microcode
*** Part 3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHWFpkGsxOs&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=38
- Again, as we did with the EEPROM design, we build the "truth table",
  input: with the "instruction" and "step"
  output: the state of the control signals
- Since we need to control 15 states, we use 2 EEPROM, with 8bit of data each
- For the "fetch stage" we have to program
  - the signals for any instruction at steps 0 and 1
*** Part 4 - Reprogramming CPU microcode with an Arduino
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUVt_KYAp-I&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=40
- Memory of the program, still being loaded manually with tips
- We use arduino again to program the EEPROM
- We write both halfs of memory.
  And then let the CI address jumpers (pin 0) decide which role they take.
- New: SUB
*** Part 5 - Adding more machine language instructions to the CPU
- STA, LDI, JMP
** 8-bit CPU reset circuit and power supply tips
*** A reset button, with a buffer
- A separate circuit that sends a reset (and inverted reset) signal to each module.
  Plus the step reset through an OR gate (with the rst that happens at step 5)
  - Can be remade using NAND gates
*** Power supply
- Full Computer consumes 1.1-1.2 amps
- BPS BB830 - High quality breadboard
- Solder Pins to USB power supply

** Making a computer Turing complete
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqNDk_UJW4k&list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU&index=42
- Current:
  - Max Clock 300Hz
  - 16 bytes of memory
  - "What you need in order to be able to compute anything?"
    - Some instructions missing, AND cannot be programmed curently either: like multiply
- Church-Turing Thesis: Something is "computable" if and only if it can be computed by a Turing machine.
- Paper: "On Computable Numbers, With and Application to the Entscheidunosproblem" / Alan Turing
  - Studies a "infinite tape" computer, with a state and a writable tape. Left and Write movable.
  - Appendix: after church paper, includes lambda calculus as something his machine can solve.
- Paper: "An Unsolvable problem of elementary number theory" -- Alonzo Church
  - The desicion problem.
  - Creates Lambda Calculus: It has variables and the ability to define functions.
  - Tring to define what can be calculated
  - Not everything computable can be solved (?)
- On our 8-bit computer, we cannot do anything different based on data from anywhere
  - A conditional Jump is missing
** TODO CPU flags register
- JZ: jump zero (if the sum is 0)
  JC: jump carry (if it is a number that cannot be represented)
