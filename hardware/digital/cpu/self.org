  - 1945
  - aka princeton architecture
  - "von neumann bottleneck"
    - An instruction to fetch something from memory to cpu. Takes 2 fetch cycles.
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_architecture
  - instructions and data do NOT share the same bus (or stored in the same place)
    - the instruction memory can be read-only
    - as a consequence they could have different
      - word width (requiring wider address bus)
      - total sizes (requiring wider data bus)a
  - used for
    - real time processing (DSPs)
    - low-power applications

** Preface
- Will cover what CPU's are, and by extension how programs work.
  Analyze *how* the first CPU worked.
- In the 1950's, you had to answer engne design question on your driver's license examination,
  but no such question remain in todays's tests.
** 1 What does the CPU do?
- Digitalization
- CPU is in charge of *operation*, using 1 and 0
  * Arithmetic Operations
  * Logic Operations
- Five Components/Systems of a modern computer
  - Control Unit (CPU): reads the program intructions from memory and interprets them.
  - Arithmetic Unit (CPU)
  - Memory System (Primary and Secondary)
  - Input Device
  - Output Device
- Programs are *instructions* that people give the computer.
  - Intructions being what data to use, and which operations to run.
- ALU ("v" shaped):
    Input (A)
    Input (B)
      Command/Input/Opcode (F)
    Output (Y)
    Status Output (S)
- Information is everything in our environment that can be regisered with any of our five senses.
- Analog vs Digital.
  A *continous* reading of an analog thermometer.
  A *discrete* reading from a digital one, where the value is read in steps (of 0.1)
- 0 and 1 *primitives*
  Illustrated with a black dot and a white one (?) respectly.
- Digital representation of information, allow us to control noise when transmitting the data.
** 2 Digital Operations
- 0 and 1, are more like indicators than numbers
- Decimal to binary conversion.
  1011
  1       0       1       1
  1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 1*2^1 + 1*2^0 =
      8 +     0 +     2 +     1 = 11 (decimal)
*** Fractional Numbers
- Fixed-Point: Works for decimals (?) too where we would use 2^-1, 2^-2, 2^-3, etc
  So they will be 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, and so on.
- Float-Point: instead of having many zeroes for small decimals.
  We could write them with negative potencies of 10.
  Like: 1.23 * 10^-6 for 0.00000123
  - We have a *significand* and a *base*
                        1.69 * 2^n
*** Addition
  0 + 0 = 0
  0 + 1 = 1
  1 + 0 = 1
  1 + 1 = 10 (the one is *carried* to the second position)
*** Substraction
- Using *two's complement* technique: adding to complements of two numbers is the same than substracting A from B.
  To substract a number, simply add its complement instead.
- A)
  15 + (-15) =   0
  15 +  (85) = 100
  - Looking at the 2 last numbers (given this is a two-digit math) the results are the same. With and *overflow* of 1.
  - We say that 85 is the ten's complement of 15.
  - A number's *complement* in some base is the smallest number you have to add to the original number to make the number's digit *oveflow*.
- B)
  9647 - 1200 =  8447
  9647 + 8800 = 18447
  - We can use 8800 as the ten's complement of 1200.
- C)
    1010 1000
    0101 1000
    ---------
  1 0000 0000
- To find the two's complement
  * Flip all the digits
  * Add 1
  - ALUs do this to add or sub, only that they add the inverted and then add 1.
*** Logic Operations
- Some gates can have >2 Inputs
- 74LS08 IC as an example.
  - IO Pines here are legs of different *logic gates*
- Logic Gates
  - And =|)-
  - Or  =)>-
  - Not -|>o-
**** Both Venn Diagrams and logic gates:
  - AND and Intersections
  - OR  and Unions
  - NOT and Complement
**** Other Basic Gates:
  - NAND =|)o-
  - NOR  =)>o-
  - XOR  =))>-
- These gates are really just combination of AND, OR and NOT gates.
  - NAND = AND NOT
  - NOR  =  OR NOT
  - XOR  = !? (Only 1 when both inputs are different)
    - Input A, splitted (one negated) into different AND
      Input B, ditto
    - Output of ANDs go into a OR
**** De Morgan's Theorem
  - A NAND gate is the same as
      using an OR gate on each input's (NOT) complement.
  - A NOR gate is the same as
      using and AND gate on each input's (NOT) complement
  - Gives new ways to represent graphically NAND and NOR gates
*** Circuit Adders
**** The Half Adder
- Only to add to single digits
- Input A, to both XOR and AND
  Input B, to both XOR and AND
- Output S (the value of A+B)
  Output C (the carry)
- If you ~ADD~ the input values into a two-digit's sum
  - Take the lower digit
    - It gives you a a XOR truth table
  - Take the upper digit
    - It givves you the AND truth table
**** The Full Adder
- By using two half adders, you can make a ~full adder~
  - Input A, to HA1
    Input B, to HA1
    Input C, to HA2 (an extra input for the carry)
  - HA1 output S to HA2
    HA1 output C to OR
  - HA2 output S to output S
    HA2 output C to OR
  - OR output to C output C
**** Ripple Carry Adder
- Using four adders, so we can add two four digits numbers, you make a ~ripple carry adder~
  - 8 inputs
  - 4 outputs S(um)
  - 1 output C(arry)
**** The Carry Look-Ahead Adder
- It takes a lot of time to keep moving the carry from one calculation to the next.
  - aka ~Propagation Delay~
  - Upper digits have to "wait" for the carry to arrive
- Delegating the carry calculations to a different ciruit. Solves it.
*** Circuits with Memory
- Memory in cpu's are called ~registers~
  - We can refer to previous calculations using them
**** Flip-Flop: The basics of memory circuits
- 2 Inputs
  2 Outputs (Q and (not Q)), so one is always the opposite to the other
- Called Latches
***** R(eset)S(et)
- Setting 1 to S, will   set Q to 1
  Setting 1 to R, will reset Q to 0
- Basically it remembers which one got a signal last.
- Can be created using 2 NAND (or 2 NOR) gates
- Truth table
  |    IN |    IN |        OUT |        OUT | Function                   |
  |-------+-------+------------+------------+----------------------------|
  | not S | not R |          Q |      not Q |                            |
  |     1 |     1 | NOT CHANGE | NOT CHANGE | Retains its current output |
  |     0 |     1 |          1 |          0 | Set                        |
  |     1 |     0 |          0 |          1 | Reset                      |
  |     0 |     0 |          1 |          1 | Not Allowed                |
***** D(data)
- Input Data (D)
  Input Clock (C), with a *rising edge* (aka when the clock goes from 0 to 1)
  - The clocks interval highs and low have nothing to do, with the circuit's I/O
- Outputs Q and (not Q)
- Every time a rising edge passes, the input D (0 or 1) is copied directly into Q
***** T(oggle)
- Has only 1 Input (T)
- The value of Q changes only when 1->0 (or in others when it goes from 0->1)
- ~Counter circuit~: Chaining several T-flip-flops (of *falling edge*) you can make a circuit that counts (!)
  - With 1 Input, and several outputs that must be read at the same time to get the binary counter output.
  - Asynchronous counters, since not all flip-flops are connected to the same clock
  - It is possible to make counters from D flip-flops too, OR count downs.
** 3 CPU Architecture
- ~Addresses~: the memory locations
  - CPU has full control over this *address space*
  - CPU refers to memory using memory address pointers
- Read/Write: is an electrical operation in memory.
  Load/Store: refers to the operations with *registers*
- I/O ports connect *directly* to the cpu (not for usb or display)
*** ~Data bus~:   <-> The BUS that transports data
  - External: between memory and CPU (USB?????), indicate how much can be send.
  - Internal: Inside the CPU, indicate how much can be processed.
    - ~Multiplexer~ (MUX), switches that can change the flow of memory
  - Buses are bundled ~signal pathways~ (lines that transmit 1s and 0s)
    - A bus of 4 pathways, can represent 2^4 different numbers.
    - Modern ALUs work with 64 bits, on (usually) 64-bits data buses.
*** ~Address bus~: -> The BUS that transports this addresss pointers
  - Determine the *address space size*
    - 2³² give us 4.3Gb
*** ~Control bus~: -> The BUS that conveys these control signals. Ex: READ
*** Programs
- A program is a chain of instructions.
  - Opcode: What to do
    Operands: On which (can be a memory addresses or registers)
*** Registers
- Accumulators: Uses for calculations and increasing values
- General-Purpose: Used for all kind of things
- Instruction: temporarily sore program instructions read from memory
*** Classical Architecure
- Fetch/Decode/Execute/Write
  1. P.C. (Program Counter): has the address of the next intruction to be executed.
     Address Register: Stores/Sends addresses to the Memory
  2. I.R. (Instruction Register): Stores/Receives the Instruction from Memory that we are executing
     Instruction Decoder: Interprets the instruction from Memory
  3. ALU
     Accumulator (Internal Shift Register): Result data.
  4. Write: Is then stored in a registry or in Memory (if in memory it needs an address)
- MMU (Memory Managment Unit): hardware that maps virtual memory to its physical counterparts
*** Secondary Memory (Hard Drive)
- The CPU can read directly form the primary memory, but not from the hard drive.
  The CPU sends(writes?) control signals to piece of memory called ~i/o space~.
  The disk interface then controls the disk itself.
*** Address Space
- Refers to ALL the memory outside the CPU that is *controlled* by the CPU
  - RAM: R/W
  - ROM: R (on the motherboard), where the program that runs when you power on the computer resides (the BIOS)
  - I/O Space: small, in some systems is NOT part of the address space
               GPUs have an exclusive I/O port
*** Interrupts
- They let you advance multiple task efficiently
  - Ex: So while it might busy with something, a keyboard input will still be acknowledged
**** The Stack and the Stack Pointer
- Stack: a part of memory reseved for bookkeeping
- Stack Pointer: points to the last stack address we worked with.
- During and *interrupt* some data is saved into the stack to being able to return back from it.
  - Data saved is:
    * accumulators
    * status registers
    * program counter
- Constantly calling for interruptions, can cause stack problems (?)
  - With *interrupt masks* you can avoid interrupts (traps?)
  - With *resets* you can override interrupt masks
  - With *NMI* non-maskable interrupts we also can avoid interrupt masks, without issuing a reset
  - With *timer interrupts* we can execute things at regular intervals
*** Clock
- Frequency
  1. Measured in Hz, how many times the clock cycles in one second.
     - 40MHz would be cycling 40 millon times per second
  2. Everything that the CPU does, like instruction decoding and ALU operations, it does in synchonization with the clock.
     The CPU can execute one action per clock cycle.
- Generators:
  - All components part of the clock generator, including crystal oscillator, capacitors and resistors. Contribute to the accuracy.
  - Crystal oscillators, are small artificial crystal shards, cut very thing. Voltage makes the crystal warp.
    It's possible to get a stable frequency from them.
*** Timer Interrupts
- Timer Interrupt Control INPUTS:
  - RESET: to start the timer
  - INT: used to send instructions
- How:
  1) By applying a prescaler (frequency divider) ot the *master clock*
  2) We get a *timer basis clock* used along a decreasing timer.
  3) When count reaches zero the Timer gets triggered and interrups the CPU.
- Registers used:
  1) Select: used to indicate the multiplication factor of the *frequency divider*
  2) Initial Value: From which value to count.
*** Reset Signals
- To set the programs and internal circuits to their initial state.
- While powering on, the *voltage* would fluctuate until stabilize.
  - While this is happening the reset signal is hold. To protect the CPU.
*** Performance
- Measured in how quickly can perform calculation one after the another
  - MIPS: Millions Instructions Per Second.
    When computers only could do integer operations.
  - MFLOPS: Million floationg-point Operations Per Second
    Floating point operations with 15 significant digits.
** 4 Operations
*** Instruction Types
- They are in machine language (0 and 1)
- Calculation
  1. Arithmetic: Add, Sub
  2. Logic: And, Or, Not
  3. Bit Shift: Performed in the accumulator
- No Calculations
  1. Data Transfer
  2. Input and Output
  3. Branching
  4. Conditionals (comparisons)
- Negative number: We use the two's complement to get the negative.
  Ex: that's why 101 is 5 unsigned and -3 signed
*** Binary Shifts
- Direction:
  - Right-shifting: dividing by 2^n
  - Left-shifting: multiplying by 2^n
- Types:
  - Logical (no sign bit)
    * we fill with zero always
  - Arithmetic: (has sign bit)
    * right-shift: we fill with the sign bit value
    * left-shift: we fill with the sign bit value, but wle *overflow* and mark it so on a *overflow flag/bit* saying that it did
- There are also *circular shifts*
*** Data Transfer Instructions
- For cpu-memory and register-register read/write.
*** Input/Output Instructions
- I/O Ports
*** Branch Instructions
- By Distance:
  - Skip Instructions: can either, skip or not skip the next instruction.
  - Branch Instructions: branch to addresses not far from the execution site
  - Jump Instructions: jump to addreses farther away.
- By Condition (see conditional instructions)
  - Unconditional
  - Conditional
- Also: STOP and SLEEP
*** Condition Evaluation
- Using the STATUS Output bit of the ALU
  - In reality, these are *status registers* or flags:
    1. sign flag
    2. carry flag
*** Operands & Operations
- Example:
  #+begin_src asm
LDA ADDRESS.1 // Loads address.1 into ACC
ADD ADDRESS.2 // Adds  address.2 to   ACC
STA ADDRESS.3 // Stores ACC into address.3
  #+end_src
- Operators Arity: 0, 1, 2
  - 0: ex: "the set accumulator to 1 opcode"
  - Many 0 or 1 work with what is on the accumulator.
  - 2: usualy first argument is "source" and second is "destination"
- Kinds
  - Immediate value processing: is the value
  - Address reference: external or internal addresses
- Addressing modes: some OPCODES don't allow some
  1) Absolute: the ~effective address~
  2) Relative: result of current PC (or xx-register) and the value in the address provided (might be due long memory address)
  3) Indirect: pointer
  4) Address modification: when is the result of adding 2 values
     - A value in the *modification register*
     - A base value, either on pc, a register or immediate value.
     like for indexing
*** Structure of operations
- 745181, made by Texas Instruments
  745381, replace it later.
- Capable of Arithmetic and Logic Operations
  - 8 Input A, B, each of 4bits/4pins
  - 4 Output pins
  - 4 Select pins (select the operation)
  - 1 Mode Pin (select between arithmetic and logic)
  - 1 Carry Input (select carry or not carry operations)
  - G? Cn+4? P? A=B?
  - 2 GND/Vcc
*** Some Basic Flags
- Zero Flag (Z-Flag): If the result of the calculation is 0, might also be EQ-Flag (if the cpu doesn't have comparisons)
- Sign Flag (S-Flag): Sign of the result
- Carry Flag (C-Flag) or Overflow Flag (OV-Flag): carry or oveflow in addition or shift
- Borrow Flag: On substractions.
- GT,LT Flags
- Odd Flag
- Interrupt Mask: Set beforehand, determines what type of interrupts will occur. All 1's disable interrupts.
- Interrup Flag: If an interrupt is in progress.
*** Sleep Instruction
- Puts the CPU in a slep state, reducing the period of the clock.
** 5 Programs
- The lenguages that use mnemonics are *Assembly Language*
