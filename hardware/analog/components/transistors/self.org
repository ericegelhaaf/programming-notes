- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor

- 1957 (first commercially available)
- based on semiconductors changes of conductivity
- You can think of a transistors as
  - switches
  - current amplifiers
  - a variable resistors

- States
  - =Saturation=: when there is current in base
  - =Cutoff=: when there is no current in base

* Projects

* Models

- P-Channel - MOSFET
  - For power polarity protection
  - Without much Vdrop
- Phototransistor
  - a BJT that instead of base has a light detector
  - the more light, the more current will flow
  - no cadmium, unlike photoresistors
  - TEPT5600
- Darlington
  - has 2 transistors in 1 package
  - with increases gain
  - and more _voltage drop_ :(
- BC327/BC337 https://www.inventable.eu/2018/04/18/los-transistores-bc327-y-bc337/

** BC548

- https://www.inventable.eu/2017/07/09/transistor-bc548/
- https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_bc548.html

- NPN BJT
- TO-92
- Substitute and successor of BC108/148/238
- GainGroups: A/B/C with 180/300/600 current gains repectively

** 2N2222

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2N2222
- https://www.inventable.eu/2020/11/30/transistor-2n2222/

- 1960
- NPN BJT
- TO-92 (TO-18 antes)
- Equivalente a BC337/BC548
- maximo 800mA corriente de colector
