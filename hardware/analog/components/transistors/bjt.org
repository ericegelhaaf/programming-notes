- The most common
- Uses both *electrons* and *electron holes* as charge carriers.
- current controlled switch
- _voltage drop_ of 0.5v
- Multiplies (~100x) current (the Betha)
- Most transistors operate at: 0mV < Vbe < 700mV
- Legs: emitter, collector, base
- There are 2 current that could flow through a transistor
  - ~Ib~ Base Current
  - ~Ic~ Collector Current
- Allows ~Ic~ to flow, when a small ~Ib~ flows
