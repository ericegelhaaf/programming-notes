- they get rid input ~Vripple~
- input more DC voltage than we need to output
- are ICs
- are NOT transistors
- are inefficient
  #+begin_src
    Power = (Vin - Vout) * Iout
  #+end_src
- have a drop out voltage ~Vdrop~
  - minimum input voltage to get a regulated output
  - 1v or 2v above Vout
  - aka the headroom
- they have dozens of transistors
- they have 3 pins

* Parts

- Classes
  - LDO: Low Dropout Regulators

- TPS61070 - Efficient Synchronous Boost Converter
- LM2596 - Step-Down Voltage Regulator
- LM317 - Adjustable Voltage Regulator
  - Can be setup to adjust voltage based on potentiometer
    - Vout = 1.25 * (1+(R2/R1)) + 50u * R2
  - Can be also setup to provide a constant current source (while changing voltage)
    - I = 1.2 / R1

** 78xx / 79xx

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/78xx
- https://www.inventable.eu/2023/05/17/reguladores-tension-78l/

- 78xx - positive (linear) voltage regulators
- 79xx - negative (linear) voltage regulators
- where "xx" indicate the _output_ voltage
