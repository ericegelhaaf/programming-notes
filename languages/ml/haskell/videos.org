** Jun 21 | Avoid boilerplate instances with DerivingVia

- Example: given an enum of levels of alert
  #+begin_src haskell
    data DangerLevel =
      = AllOk
      | NotGreat
      | UhOh
      | RealProblemHere
      | Catastrophe
      deriving (Eq, Ord)
  #+end_src

- I want to *combine* them so I could get the highest level of alert from the given
  For that i will need to implement Monoid and Semigroup
  #+begin_src haskell
    instance Semigroup DangerLevel where
      (<>) = max
    instance Monoid DangerLevel where
      mempty = AllOk
  #+end_src

- If I have the same problem repeated, eg: I have an enum of "MovieRating".

- I could use DerivingVia.
  First by defining a ~newtype~, as a *simple wrapper* over some type "a"
  That implements/instances both Semigroup and Monoid

  #+begin_src haskell
    newtype Supremum a = MkS a
      deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded)

    instance Ord a => Semigroup (Supremum a) where
      (<>) = max
    instance (Ord a, Bounded a) => Monoid (Supremum a) where
      mempty = minBound
  #+end_src

- We could then use ~DeriveVia~ with the newtype to automatically write the instances for us.

  #+begin_src haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingVia #-}
    -- <--- Supremum newtype and instances go here
    data DangerLevel =
      = AllOk
      | NotGreat
      | UhOh
      | RealProblemHere
      | Catastrophe
      deriving (Eq, Ord, Bounded)
      deriving (Semigroup, Monoid) via (Supremum DangerLevel)
  #+end_src

- Since the relationship between "Supreme DangerLevel" and "DangerLevel" is just a *newtype*
  We can coerce from one type to another.
  It's like we were writting this code.
  #+begin_src haskell
    import Data.Coerce
    instance Semigroup DangerLevel where
      (<>) = coerce ((<>) @(Supremum DangerLevel))
  #+end_src

- We could also use it to get a inverse order, right on the *via*
  ~Down~ is a *type wrapper* that flips the orientation of Ord and Bounded instances.

  #+begin_src haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingVia #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE GeneralisedNewtypeDeriving #-}
    import Data.Ord -- for Down
    newtype FloodLevel = MkFL Int
      deriving stock Show
      deriving newtype (Ord, Eq, Bounded)
      deriving (Semigroup, Monoid) via (Supremum (Down FloodLevel))
  #+end_src

- ~newtype~ deriving is a specialization of doing DV

  #+begin_src haskell
      deriving newtype (Ord, Eq, Bounded) -- would have been the same that doing the next line
      deriving (Ord, Eq, Bounded) via Int
  #+end_src

** Nov 21 | All about `deriving` in GHC

- basic usage
  #+begin_src haskell
    module Deriving where
    data T = MkT Int Bool
      deriving (Show, Eq) -- instance Show T where show = ...
  #+end_src

- using a *newtype* Age,
  we would want to "derive" other typeclasses like Num,
  in order to use arithmethic operation from that class

- =GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving=
  "if we are deriving an instance for a class,
   that is NOT one of the built in one,
   and we are doing it for a newtype
   just copy all the definition from the representation type"
  #+begin_src haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}
    newtype Age = MkAge Int
      deriving (Show, Eq, Num) -- this would ERROR due Num without GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving
  #+end_src

- =DeriveAnyClass= to derive from an empty typeclass aka with NO METHODS
  #+begin_src haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveAnyClass #-}
    class C a
    data T = MkT Int Bool
      deriving (Show, Eq, C) -- instance C T
  #+end_src

- =DerivingStrategies= to disambiguate deriving
  =DeriveGeneric=
  #+begin_src haskell
    {-# LANGUAGE DerivingStrategies #-}
    {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}
    import Data.Aeson
    import GHC.Generics -- for FromJSON to work
    newtype Age = MkAge Int
      deriving stock (Show, Eq, Generic) -- altenative way of derive with
      deriving newtype Num
      deriving anyclass FromJSON
  #+end_src

- there's a difference whether you derive ~Show~ with stock or newtype
  - stock - will show "constructor value"
  - newtype - will show "value"

- =DerivingVia=
  a direct generalization of DerivingNewtype
  DN copies all the implementations
  DV, for any type that his representation is the same, I can do the copying

  #+begin_src haskell
    import Data.Ord -- for Down
    newtype Age = MkAge Int
      deriving Ord via (Down Int) -- take the instance of "Down Int" and copy all the methodsover to work Ord for Age
      deriving newtype (Show, Num) -- this
      deriving (Show, Num) via Int -- is the same of this
  #+end_src

**        | Not all bangs in patterns are BangPatterns
#+begin_src haskell
  {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}
#+end_src

- /case,let and where/ are lazy by default

#+begin_src haskell
z = case undefined of  x -> 'y' -- y
z = case ()        of !x -> 'y' -- y
z = case undefined of !x -> 'y' -- ERROR
z = let  y = undefined in () -- ()
z = let !y = 5 in ()         -- ()
z = let !y = undefined in () -- ERROR - is NOT a BangPattern
#+end_src

- It makes the binding strict, but it is NOT a BangPattern

#+begin_src haskell
  z = let False = True in () -- ()
  z = let !False = True in () -- runtime ERROR
  z = !(Just x) = Just undefined in () -- ()
  z = !(Just !x) = Just undefined in () -- runtime ERROR, !x it IS a BangPattern
#+end_src

* TODO 10 | Data Parallel Haskell                 | Simon Peyton Jones

- DSL for GPU https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~gbm26/files/mainland10nikola.pdf

- 3(three) forms of concurrency
  1) explicit threads: non-deterministic by design, monadic =forkIO= and =STM=
     #+begin_src haskell
       main :: IO ()
       main =
         do
           ch <- newChan
           forkIO (ioManager ch)
           forkIO (worker 1 ch)
          -- ...
     #+end_src
  2) semi-explicit: determinisitic, pure (~par~ and ~seq~)
     #+begin_src haskell
       f :: Int -> Int
       f x = a `par` b `seq` a + b
         where
           a = f (x-1)
           b = f (x-2)
     #+end_src
  3) data parallel: deteministic, pure (parallel arrays), shared memory initially, distributed memory eventually

- Data parallelism types

  1) Flat Data Parallelism
     - apply _sequential_ operations on bulk data
     - does not create a thread for every op, it groups them in bulks
     - Limited applicability: dense matris, map/reduce

  2) Nested Data Parallelism
     - apply _parallel_ operations on bulk data
     - allows for each work to be further paralleised (branching)
     - Wider applicability: sparse matrix, graph algorithms
     - easier for the programmer, harder to implement locallity

- It is possible to write a "compiler" that "flattens" a program written
  in the "nested data parallelism" style into a "flat data parallism" algorithm.
  aka flattening or vectorization

- NESL, a parallel programming language released in 1993
  Based on "Nested Data Parallelism".
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESL

- 50:00 vectorization...

** Flat Data Paralleism Examples

- Array comprehensions

  #+begin_src haskell
    -- [:Float:] is the type of parallel arrays of Float
    vecMul :: [:Float:] -> [:FLoat:] -> Float
    vecMul v1 v2 = sumP [: f1*f2 | f1 <- v1 | f2 <- v2 :]
  #+end_src

- Sparse vector multiplicatin

  #+begin_src haskell
    svMul :: [:(Int,Float):] -> [:Float:] -> Float
    svMul sv v = sumP [: f*(v!i) | (i,f) <- sv :]
  #+end_src

- Sparse matrix
  #+begin_src haskell
    smMul :: [:[:(Int,Float):]:] -> [:Float:] -> Float
    smMul sm v = sumP [: svMul sv v | sv <- sm :]
  #+end_src

- shell pipes and (some) commands, are functional, pure, and lazy (as soon as they able output)
  $ cat poem | tr a-z a-Z | sed -e 's/$/!!!/'

- shell pipes-like written in Haskell
  #+begin_src haskell
    main :: IO ()
    main = readFile "poem" >>= putStr . process

    process :: String -> String
    process = unlines . sort . lines
  #+end_src

** functions

- we can factor it out the pattern of working with lines
  #+begin_src haskell
    byLines f = unlines . f . lines
  #+end_src

- examples
  #+begin_src haskell
    sortLines     = byLines sort
    reverseLines  = byLines reverse
    firstTwoLines = byLines (take 2)
  #+end_src

- in order to work with each string with ~map~
  #+begin_src haskell
    indentEachLine :: String -> String
    indentEachLine = byLines (map indent)
  #+end_src

- we factor it out again
  #+begin_src haskell
    eachLine :: (String -> String) -> String -> String
    eachLine f = unlines . map f . lines

    indentEachLine :: String -> String
    indentEachLine = eachLine indent
  #+end_src

- The turning or ~indent~ function, which only works with =String=
  to a version of ~indent~ that works with =[String]=
  we call that /lifting up/.

- We can keep going and work on each "word" on each "line"
  #+begin_src haskell
    eachWordOnEachLine :: (String -> String) -> String -> String
    eachWordOnEachLine f = eachLine (eachWord f)

    yellEachWordOnEachLine :: String -> String
    yellEachWordOnEachLine = eachWord yell
  #+end_src

** Example: defining a new ~data~ type for List

#+begin_src haskell
  data List a
    = EndOfLIst
    | Link a (List a)

  empty = EndOfList
  oneWord = Link "apple" EndOfList
  twoWords = Link "banana" (Link "cantaloupe" EndOfList)
  mystery3 = Link "pineapple" mystery3 -- infinite list, haskell is fine with this
#+end_src

** power Alternatives <|>

#+begin_src haskell
  (<|>) :: Alternative f => f a -> f a -> f a
#+end_src

- instances: Maybe, []

- short-circuit evaluation based on =Maybe=
  returns the first =Just= it gets or =Nothing=
  #+begin_src haskell
    pickShow :: Person -> Maybe String
    pickShow p =
      favoriteShow (name p)     -- String -> Maybe String
      <|> showWithName (name p) -- String -> Maybe String

- 18:40 When we declare a function with a type class (constraint?)
  - the compiler "adds an extra argument" to the function, the arg is kind of like a "vtable/read-table"
    - like a implicit argument passing
    - a record with the instance declarations functions for the typeclass
- A *class* declaration turns into a *data* declaration
- *instance* declarations turns into a record with the function instances
- Constants are also overloaded, "1" is "(fromInteger d 1)"

  1) Types guarantee the absence of ceratin classes of errors
     - True + 'c'
     - segfaults
  2) The static type of a function is a *partial (machine checked) specification*
  3) Types are a design language. The UML of Haskell.
  4) Types massively support interactive program development.
  5) Their support for software maintenance
